# Final Project

# New Restaurant Menu

## Description

As a rebranding restaurant, we are aiming to please the customers. Therefore, we want to get the customers opinions on what should be on the menu. We have set up a series of of online procedures to do just that.

## Solution

While some restaurants hire certain individuals to revitalize a menu, we want to hear from the customers themselves, and what they want to see on the menu. Customers will be able to input there opinions online for evryone to see, and the items with the most tallies will be on our new menu!

## Instructions

### /menu

Typing /menu will allow you to see the categories for which we want your help in choosing what will be on the menu.

### /menu/"category"

You will have four categories to choose from: pizza, subs, appetizers, and drinks. Clicking on a category will bring you to the page where you tell us your opinion.

#### /"category" could be any of /pizza , /subs , /apps , or /drinks
#### Example: /menu/pizza will bring you to the pizza voting page, and the same goes for /menu/subs , /menu/apps , and /menu/drinks.

After inputting your information, click the submit button, and it will redirect you to a page confirming your submission.
